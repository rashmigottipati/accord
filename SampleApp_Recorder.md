The Wave Recorder sample application demonstrates how to use the [IAudioOutput](http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_Audio_IAudioOutput.htm) and [IAudioSource](http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_Audio_IAudioSource.htm) interfaces to capture and output sound. This is just a sample application, however. The intent of the framework is not to allow building of audio players, but to support the [use of audio signals in machine learning and statistics experiments](SampleApp_IndependentComponentAnalysis.md).
