<h1><a href='http://accord-framework.net'>Accord.NET development has shifted to GitHub</a></h1>

<b>Accord.NET</b> is a framework for scientific computing in .NET. The framework builds upon  <i>AForge.NET</i>, an also popular framework for image processing, supplying new tools and libraries. Those libraries encompass a wide range of scientific computing applications, such as statistical data processing, machine learning, pattern recognition, including but not limited to, computer vision and computer audition. The framework offers a large number of probability distributions, hypothesis tests, kernel functions and support for most popular performance measurements techniques.<br>
<br>
<br>
The library is <a href='https://github.com/accord-net/framework/commits/development'>under a very active development cycle</a>. Those GoogleCode pages are not being updated anymore because the project has moved to GitHub. See you there!<br>
