In January 2014, Google started disabling the ability for project owners to create new software releases through Google Code, without offering any suitable alternative for this system.

The Accord.NET Framework has thus started a gradual migration to GitHub, offering the same [installer executables, binaries and source packages](https://github.com/accord-net/framework/releases) previously offered here. You don't have to clone the repository or anything like that in order to keep using the project: everything is as simple as it has always been.

Previous framework releases can also  [still be found here](https://code.google.com/p/accord/downloads/list).
