This sample application shows how to use the [Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)](http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_MachineLearning_RANSAC_1.htm) algorithm to fit [linear regression models](http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/N_Accord_Statistics_Models_Regression_Linear.htm). The algorithm works with any model or function, producing a robust version of the model which is less sensitive to outliers.
